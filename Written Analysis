SQL Analysis of Hewlett Packard Employee Database
Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to help Hewlett Packard understand the impacts of the coming, so-called “silver tsunami”. 
This analysis will query the Hewlett Packard employee database along the indices of title, age, tenure, and other factors, in order to determine an optimal mentorship program. 
In short: retiring employees who have a high degree of institutional knowledge will be paired with younger employees who are in similar career tracks to pass on that knowledge.

Results:
There are two major questions to be addressed in this analysis:
*How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
*Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
*The analysis indicates that there are a large number of roles to be filled as the “silver tsunami” hits. 
*However, as a corollary, there is, for the time being, a large cohort of mentors available to bring up the next generation of HW leaders. 

Conclusion:
It is important to begin implementing the mentorship program in earnest to ensure it that institutional knowledge is passed on in an optimal way before the mentor 
cohort retires in greater numbers.
